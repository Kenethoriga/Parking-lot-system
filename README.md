This code is a simple implementation of a parking lot management system. The system can manage a parking lot without any human intervention. It can perform the following functions:

Create a parking lot with a specified number of floors and slots per floor.
Park a vehicle by finding the first available slot based on the vehicle type, and park it on the lowest possible floor and slot number.
Generate a ticket with a unique ID for the parked vehicle.
Unpark a vehicle given the ticket ID.
Display the number of free slots per floor for a specific vehicle type.
Display all the free slots per floor for a specific vehicle type.
Display all the occupied slots per floor for a specific vehicle type.
The code is designed to be modular, readable, and easily extensible to accommodate new requirements with minimal changes. It can be tested using the provided input/output format and main method. The code can also be extended to support multiple parking lots, different types of vehicles and slot types, and different strategies for finding the first available slot.
